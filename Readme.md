## 📝 Introduction

This project was developed as the final capstone for the **Market Ready Developer Internship** with [Gaza Sky Geeks](https://gazaskygeeks.com/), showcasing full-stack development, teamwork, and real-world agile collaboration.

### The Problem

Many individuals struggle to track their income and expenses effectively, leading to poor financial decisions. Without clear visibility into spending habits, it becomes difficult to save, stick to a budget, or plan for the future.

### Our Solution

We built **Personal Finance Tracker**—a secure, intuitive web application that simplifies financial management for individuals and small businesses. It enables users to track transactions, create budgets, and visualize their financial health with interactive dashboards.
