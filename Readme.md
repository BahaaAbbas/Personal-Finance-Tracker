## ⚡ Challenges We Faced

During the development of this project, our team encountered several personal and professional challenges that required strong collaboration and adaptability:

* Different Time Zones & Commitments → One of our members was abroad starting a new job, making time coordination more complex.
* Industry Experience vs. Academic Workload → Another member was already employed in the tech industry, needing to balance professional tasks with academic responsibilities.
* Training & Workload Management → Some team members were simultaneously engaged in internships and part-time jobs, which created additional scheduling challenges.
* Transition from Graduation → A member who had recently graduated faced the challenge of adapting to new responsibilities while contributing effectively to the project.

Despite these challenges, we relied on clear communication, agile practices, and strong teamwork to stay on track. This experience strengthened our problem-solving skills and taught us how to deliver under real-world constraints.
